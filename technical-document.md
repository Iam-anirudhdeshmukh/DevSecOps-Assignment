# üõ°Ô∏è Shift Left Security in CI/CD Pipeline

## üìò Overview

This project implements **Shift Left Security** by integrating automated security checks into the CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions**. Security testing is executed during development (on PRs and commits) to ensure vulnerabilities are caught **before** reaching production.

## üß∞ Security Tools Implemented

| Check Type                         | Tool Used                        | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Static Application Security Testing (SAST) | [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/)       | Analyzes code for vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, XSS, etc.             |
| Dependency Scanning               | [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) | Scans for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in package dependencies              |
| Code Linting with Security Rules  | ESLint + eslint-plugin-security | Detects insecure code patterns and enforces best practices                  |
| Secret Scanning                   | [Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) | Finds hardcoded secrets like API keys and credentials                      |
| Container Image Scanning          | Trivy (Image Mode)               | Scans Docker images for OS-level and application-level CVEs                |
